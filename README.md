## Info
### What is randomized in this game?

All suits upgrade, keys (Sky Temple Keys and other Temple Keys) and expansion items are shuffled.
Other Temple Keys are colored depending on the region and can be shuffled locally, remotely or put vanilla or you can even start with them.

### What is the goal of Metroid Prime 2 - Echoes when randomized?

The main goal is reaching Sky Temple, then beat the final bosses (if final bosses are on).

### Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the mentioned items above in the section "What is randomized in this game?". Except Varia Suit and Combat Visor.

### What does another world's item look line in Metroid Prime 2 - Echoes?

Metroid serie items will be based on the corresponding model from Metroid Prime 2 - Echoes when available for now.
This might change in the future.

Multiworld items are not defined yet though.

### What versions of Metroid Prime 2 - Echoes are supported?

So far only GC versions. But Wii versions are planned to be working by first release.

### Can I teleport to the starting room?

Not yet. But it is planned to be added.

### What happens to my own collected items at Game Over or if the game is reset without saving?

The items are remote items, even if it's your own. So if you were connected at that time, you sent those items and thus you will receive them back when you're back ingame.

### What are the differences between vanilla and randomized game?

- Layout Changes
  - Item Loss Sequence is permanently removed
  - Starting Room can be set. For now it will be reserved to Save Station rooms.
  - Elevator destinations will be possible to be randomized. Although the patcher has no support for it yet.
  - Portal destinations will be possible to be randomized. Although the patcher has no support for it yet.
